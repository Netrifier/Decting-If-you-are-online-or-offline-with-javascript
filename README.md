# Decting If you are online or offline with javascript

This is the code to the project:- https://youtu.be/sSjnORLAz-A

In this project I will show you how you can easily detect if you are online or offline with vanilla javascript.

You can change the tags to whatever you want and you can use your own images.

You can implement this in your website. But you are not allowed to make a video and post it on YouTube without my permission and without giving me credit.

If don't know how to make a website I will be making a course about it in the future.
